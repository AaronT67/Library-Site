				<p>I like chicken i like chicken i like chicken i like chciken i like chicken i like chicken i like chicken i like chicken“Why…” I face the mirror, as if I was looking for answers. Instead I see a red, teary wet face with an ugly posture. “Why…” Trying to fix my hair, I pull back my bangs with a clip. A few seconds has passed before I was unconsciously reapplying make up over freshly warm tears. “Come on…stop crying….please.” Eyes still looking into the mirror to find my misplaced smile. Instead the reflection changes. From a broken face, to a pair of perfect ones. Both gazing into each other eyes with joy. The view radiating with affection and love. A new coat of tears covered my cheeks before the next image appears, and the next, and the next. All the looks of happy duos. I could hear my heart racing in my throat as the mirror glows green. In a flash the reflection changes with a different setting.
